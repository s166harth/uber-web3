# Uber Web3 Clone

This is a work-in-progress project to create a decentralized, Web3-based ride-sharing platform, inspired by Uber. The project uses various Web3 technologies, such as smart contracts and IPFS, to create a peer-to-peer platform that is more secure, transparent, and efficient.

## Features

The Uber Web3 Clone project will include the following features:

- User registration: Allows users to register their accounts and profiles on the platform.
- Ride booking: Allows users to book rides on the platform, with various options for pickup location, destination, and payment.
- Driver registration: Allows drivers to register their accounts and profiles on the platform.
- Ride acceptance: Allows drivers to accept or reject ride requests, based on their availability and preferences.
- Ride tracking: Allows users and drivers to track the progress of their rides, and communicate with each other in real-time.
- Payment processing: Allows for secure, transparent, and fast payments using Web3 technologies, such as smart contracts and cryptocurrency.

## Installation

To run the Uber Web3 Clone locally, you will need to have the following installed on your system:

- Node.js and NPM
- Truffle framework
- Ganache or a similar Ethereum development blockchain
- IPFS

Once you have installed these dependencies, clone the project repository to your local machine and run the following commands:

```
npm install
truffle migrate --reset
npm run start
```

This will start the development server and launch the Uber Web3 Clone app in your default web browser.

## Usage

To use the Uber Web3 Clone app, you will need to have a Web3-enabled browser, such as MetaMask, installed on your system. You can use this browser to connect to your local blockchain and interact with the smart contracts and IPFS.

Use the user registration feature to create a new user account, and the driver registration feature to create a new driver account. Once you have registered, you can use the ride booking feature to book a ride, and the ride acceptance feature to accept or reject ride requests as a driver. You can use the ride tracking feature to track the progress of your rides, and the payment processing feature to make or receive payments for your rides.
